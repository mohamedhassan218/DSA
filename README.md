In this repo, I push all code that I've implemented to build some data structure or to implement some important algorithms.     

### Data Structure Practicing
A folder that contains implementation to some data structures from scratch in cpp.


### Data Structures Implementations
A folder that contains the implementation of the data structures from the book [C++ plus Data Structures](https://www.amazon.com/Plus-Data-Structures-Nell-Dale/dp/1284089185).

### LeetCode
A folder that contains solutions for some problems from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/). You can find the problems in this list: [link](https://leetcode.com/problem-list/top-interview-questions/?page=1). 
Also contains solutions for SQL problems. You can find them here: [link](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-sql-50/)

### Problem Solving on Hakerrank and Codeforces
A folder that contains solutions for some problems from [Hakerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) & [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/). You can find the problems in this two lists:
- [Hakerrank list](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/algorithms?badge_type=problem-solving)
- [Codeforces list](https://codeforces.com/group/MWSDmqGsZm/contests )

Feel free to take the code, customize it and try different ideas.
